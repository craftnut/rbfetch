# rbfetch
 Simple fetch script written in Ruby for fun.
 Early WIP, Currently only works on Windows, Linux support will be added soon.
 Could be considered a Ruby redo of <a href="https://www.github.com/craftnut/nicofetch"> nicofetch</a>, as I intend to build something similar, but with better functionality.
 *README will be expanded once the program is more finished*.
